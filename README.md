## How it works

- Bootstrapped from [Chrome Extension Starter](https://github.com/MichaelYuhe/chrome-extension-starter)
- Inspired by [Claude Artifacts](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-3-5-sonnet).
- Get artifacts from ChatGPT through DOM monitoring.
- Preview the artifacts in the extension sidepanel(HTML only for now).
- Deploy the HTML file to [Zeabur](https://zeabur.com) with a random domain.
